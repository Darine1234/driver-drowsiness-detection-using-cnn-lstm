# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection Using CNN-LSTM




## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a sophisticated driver drowsiness detection system using a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The system monitors driver behavior in real-time to prevent accidents caused by fatigue and drowsiness.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines CNN for spatial features and LSTM for temporal sequence analysis
- **Real-time Detection**: Continuous monitoring of driver's facial features
- **High Accuracy**: Advanced deep learning model trained on extensive datasets
- **Multi-class Classification**: Detects multiple states of drowsiness
